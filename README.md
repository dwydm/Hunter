<h2>Hunter</h2>
<p>Hunter is a console-based game with a randomly generated map. The computer's movement is random until the player appears in its vicinity. The game features various elements, including walls and hedges that the player can use to hide. Stepping on the same place as another game piece either scores points for the player or ends the game.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Clone repository and run HunterDemo to start the game</p>

<p>Player is asked for a name, then the first letter of that name is displayed on the game board. Computer pieces move at random, but they perform vicinity check if the player is in range. If player is in range, then computer piece moves deliberately to get a score.</p>
